Possibly overlooked pain points, possibilities for optimization, savings options, productivity improvements, or bold ideas on future directions — these are just some of the benefits you may expect. You can count on a thorough assessment of your software development process, your infrastructure, and your potential for digital success.<br><br>How does it work? At Codete, we start our audit and consulting services by understanding our client’s business goals and needs, then scrutinizing their software development processes bit-by-bit. Our consultants analyze team workflows and proceed to interview individual team members to get a larger picture. Then, we conduct detailed code review sessions. We also take a look at the tools in use, already implemented solutions, and at the infrastructure. We investigate everything from project management methods and day-to-day work to scalability and security of your technological toolset.<br><br>The results of our audit are communicated in the form of a final report. It’s a comprehensive catalog consisting of broad technical documentation, a list of implemented optimizations, and a set of insights and further recommendations. It’s not only a tailored action plan for boosting a company’s productivity and improving their software development processes and quality of their code, but also a guidebook on cutting costs, avoiding risks, and introducing innovations.</p>
